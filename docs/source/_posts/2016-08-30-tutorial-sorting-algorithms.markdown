#### How to approach sorting

Asking clarifying questions is key: sorting a very large list of integers can have different approach, depending on its input size, data structure, numeric range and distribution.

* Small range: O(n) with array-based map.
* Medium range: O(wn) with radix sort.
* Arbitrary number: O(n log n)

Example: "Design an algorithm to sort a list".

* What kind of list? Array list or linked list? Array list.
* What data in it? Numbers or characters or strings? Numbers.
* Are numbers integers? Yes.
* What range of numbers? Are they IDs or values of something? Ages of customers.
* How many numbers? One million.
