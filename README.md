Python scripts and fun projects.

* **PerformanceLog**: Cassandra performance test by logging JMX values. Cloned from my Cassandra repo.
* **InteractivePython**: Game programming exercises in Cousera's "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python". 
  * It does not follow the standard programming pratices (e.g., global variables), but the educational approach (and the game) is good and fun.
* **CodeJam**: algorithm exercises, programming puzzles, answers to questions in job interviews.
