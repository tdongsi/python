# Interactive Python

This Python project contains several game programming exercises in Cousera's "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python". As an introductory course to Python, it does not follow the standard programming practices (e.g., global variables), but the educational approach (and the games) is good and fun. The exercises seem beneficial to all, probably even to experienced Python programmers, on how to approach to programming a seemingly complicated game from scratch.

# Screenshots

This section shows screenshots of several assignments, i.e. completed "games".

## StopWatch

First GUI application. Score a point if you stop exactly at a full second (e.g., at 1:02.0 ). Not really a game unless you are really bored.
